# Brain Tumor MRI Segmentation (2D UNet)

This repository contains a simple implementation of semantic segmentation for brain tumors using a 2D UNet architecture on multi-modal MRI scans.

This project was developed as part of my BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence coursework at the University of East London (**First Class Honours**). It demonstrates my understanding of pixel-wise prediction workflows and medical image preprocessing ‚Äî essential skills for AI in medical imaging.

## üß© Project Overview

Accurate brain tumor segmentation is a key step in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. In this assignment, I implemented:

- Preprocessing of multi-channel brain MRI images.
- A 2D UNet model architecture for semantic segmentation.
- Training and evaluation using Dice score and pixel-wise accuracy.
- Visual comparison of ground truth masks and predicted segmentation.
